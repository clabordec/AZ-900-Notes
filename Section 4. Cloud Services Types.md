# Cloud Service Types

The 3 types of cloud services

- Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

<br>

### "As a Service"

- You can rent it for a short time, if you wish
- No commitment, if you wish
- Pay for what you use (time, GB, or others)
- Cloud provider takes care of buying, developing, and maintaining it

<br>
<br>

## Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)

- There are the essential services of technology
  - Computing
  - Storage
  - Networking

- Generally have "real world" equivalents in your own data center
- Cloud replacements of real world things

<br>

### Iaas Computing

- One example is Azure Machines
- Pay by the second
  - If I use a vm for 4 hours 21 minutes and 24 seconds, that is all that I would pay for
- Many choices in CPU speeds, RAM, optimizations

<br>

### Iaas Storage

- Azure Storage is one example of this
- 5 PB of storage capacity
- Can handle blobs, files, queues and tables
- Can also be configured as a data lake

<br>

### Iaas Networking

- Virtual Networking is one example of this
- Virtual Networks don't cost anything
- There are ingress and egress bandwidth costs


<br>
<br>


## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Cloud service providers have an opportunity to provide more than just the "basic" infrastructure
- PaaS includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage and networking
- Middleware, development tools, database server, and more

<br>

### PasS Computing

- One example is Azure App Services
- Simply upload your code and configuration to Azure, and it runs your code without needing to worry about the VM underneath
- Includes scaling features, CI/CD, containers, staging and development environments, etc

<br>

### PaaS Storage

- Managed Storage is an example of this
- Azure SQL Database is another example
- Freed from worrying about the server VM itself or the hard disk itself

<br>

### PaaS Networking

- Azure Front Door is an example of this
- Load Balancer
- Firewall
- These are software applications that perform networking tasks


<br>
<br>


## Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Cloud apps
- Tools such as Office 365, OneDriver, Skype
- The app is ready to be used and you simply need to set it and use it

# Serverless

- Some services in Azure have a "Serverless" option
- Serverless is effectively a different pricing model
- Paying for service not renting hardware

<br>
<br>

## Serverless Services

- Functions
- Container Apps
- Kubernetes
- SQL Database
- Cosmos DB
