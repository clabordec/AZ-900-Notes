## Methods to Avoid Planned Outage

- Gradual deployment strategy
  - 1-10-100-etc
    - Company with hundreds or thousand don't deploy all servers at once, they'll deploy to just a handful of servers maybe one server, then they'll deploy to a few dozen servres or a hundred servers, and then they will grow to being the entire application.
  - Testing and monitoring of deployment
